# Propensity score
## Summary of the paper
This paper is the foundational paper for propensity score which has been used widely in experimental designs. The authors described the challeneges to perform causal inference with observation data, which are without randomization. To find a solution to this type of data, the authors proposed the concept of propensity score. They firstly start off by stating the balancing score which is any function b(x) such that conditional on b(x), the distribution of x is independent of z. Then, they define the propensity score e(x) = P(z = 1|x), that is, the probability of a unit with covariate values x receiving the treatment. After their proofs on the theory, they have mentioned matching or stratifying individuals based on their propensity scores, can make comparable groups with similar distributions of covariates, in order to estimate causal effect of treatment, with the underlying assumption. In the end, simulation study was performed and practical applications in real life has been discussed for wider use of propensity score.
## Reaction to the paper
This paper offers a groundbreaking work for helping to find feasible soltution to make causal inference on nonrandomized data, which is something presented to be a great problem in papers we have read and discussed in last weeks. The work is thorough to prove theorectically and practically the potential use of propensity score, by balancing the distributions of observed characteristics between the treatment and control groups. However, we should be cautious when taking the propensity scores. Firstly, we should know it is based on assumptions that treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes conditional on the propensity score, as well as the common support between two groups. However, there are also a lot of assumptions stated nowadays were not discussed in the paper, which were slowly extended later than the publication of this work, which we also should be paying attention to.
## Questions for discussion
What are the other underlying assumptions for propensity score analysis except those mentioned in the paper?

What are the other methods for addresing confounding compared to propensity score analysis?
