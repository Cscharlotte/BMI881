# Gene set enrichment analysis
## Summary of the papers
These were the papers putting forward the analytical method gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The method was developed to solve the problem that the traditional analysis of gene expression data only focused on identifying individual genes differentially expressed between experimental conditions, which in turn overlooked the coordinated behavior of functionally related genes within pathways or biological processes. The null hypothesis of this method assumed that the gene ranking was random concerning the sample's diagnostic categorization. Then they measured the association using a non-parametric summing statistic called enrichment score, while they recorded the maximum ES (MES) over all gene sets in the affected individual. To determine the statistical significance of MES, permutation testing of diagnostic labels was performed and the significance of the MES score was calculated as the fraction of permutations. In the later paper, the authords polished their work on different dataset, they have applied normalization to the ES and controlled it using false discovery rate (FDR). Meanwhile, they introduced the concept of the leading-edge subset, consisting of core genes within a gene set contributing to the enrichment signal, for a better biological interpretation.


## Reaction to the papers
The concept of moving from study in individual genes to predefined sets or pathways and analyzing their coordinated behaviors should be an interesting and hot topic back decade ago. It could help to prompt more thoughts for researchers to develop relevant methods and gain a more comprehensive understanding of biological systems, which we now are very familiar and know to be very important for omics research. When the authords developed their method, they have made GASEA-P and MSigDB both open source so that researchers anywhere can access, use, modify, and contribute to these resources, fostering collaboration and innovation in the area. This was a good idea to encourages widespread utilization of their tools and facilitates their integration into various research studies.
 


## Questions for discussion
How did the weighted running-sum statistic improve upon the earlier method that used equal weights for each step?

What is the difference between estimating the significance level of the Enrichment Score from GSEA and traditional approaches, for instance, FWER?
