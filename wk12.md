# Bootstrapping a Regression Equation: Some Empirical Results
## Summary of the papers
The article focused on the application of bootstrap in the area of econometrics, specifically on estimating standard errors in the context of industry energy demand equations. COmpared to conventional asymptotic formulas for standard error estimation, bootstrap was shown to provide more reliable estimates with a finite sample. The authors have mentioned that in generalized least squares with estimated covariance matrices, the old menthods can be overly optimistic. Through empirical evidence and mathematical reasoning, the article underscores scenarios where conventional estimates fail and where the bootstrap outperforms. With the case study with the forecasting model RDFOR which predicts energy demand, the authors pointed out that GLS estimator and its standard errors not very accurate due to inadequate data to estimate parameter, when they also talked about underlying reasons for inaccurate estimation. They also further extended the discussion to multivariate models. Lastly, algorithms, and the stability of the Monte Carlo experiments were discussed. Using the TROLL econometric modeling system, it was stated that running bootstrap is cheap however validating it is much more expensive.
