# Mammography
## Summary of the papers
This paper discussed the controversy surrounding the recommendation of regular mammography for women aged 40-49 years. The author would like to conduct a meta-analysis of multiple randomized trials, to provide a way of presenting the benefits and risks of mammography to help women make informed screening decisions. Though there were randomized controled trials, the non-compliance could be concerning for the reliance of study results. Meanwhile, although the mortality rates of control group was generally higher than the screening group, still some of the studies did not show a decrease in mortality with mammograhy. With assessing confidence intervals and statistics, the author argues the whether passing significance level solely cannot be used to conclude the screening was beneficial. They also presented a Bayesian analysis to incrporate the heterogenity of different trials. Better follow-up and information about risks of mammography should be provided to women in demand of the screening were needed.
## Reaction to the papers
This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of statistical methods employed in screening trials, pointing out the limitations of relying only on statistical significance. It is always important to keep in mind when doing analysis. However, there was a debate from the follwing commentary, notifying the conclusion of significant reduction was confusing and wrong. It brought up a even more interesting and important topic on interpretation of statistical analyses. Besides, paying attention to the heterogenity of studies and statistical power also demands a lot of work. 
## Questions for discussion
What are the key factors that should be considered when assessing mammographic screening in this age group?

How statistician should do about both clinical and statistical significance when evaluating the benefits or limitations of drugs/tests?
