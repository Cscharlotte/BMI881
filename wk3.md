# On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, John Snow
## Summary of the paper/ book 
The first 68 pages of this book written by John Snow described some history and pathological facts of cholera, along with its communication approaches. In the meantime, the author listed relevant analysis, research and hypothesis, arguing for a new claim that the cholera can be communicating through water. For his research, he drawn maps depicting the locations of cholera cases to visualize the geographic distribution of the disease, tracing all the evidences and instances, and collecting water from multiplr sources, followed with analysis. He then was ensured that the cholera outbreak was caused by the polluted water supply pump.
## Reaction to the paper
This work was known be the foundational work of epidemiology and it was a great work to help solve the problem of cholera, saving people's life. It is has shown me at a early time, even though the theory and technology of data science was unmature, a pretty rigorous analysis could be done, involving investigation, data collection, and graphical mapping, which had a tremendous impact on the society. Meanwhile, it also shown us the importance of learning and receiving helps from previous studies and colleagues, when conduting research, no matter if they are right or wrong.

## Questions for discussion
What advances we have now change the field of epidemiology since 1900s in terms of technology and data analysis?

How did John Snow effectively communicate his findings to the general audience, and what can we learn from it?
