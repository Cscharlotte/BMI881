# Statistical significance for genomewide studies
## Summary of the papers
This paper discusses the challenges in analyzing large genomic datasets, where thousands of features are tested against a null hypothesis. The authors have shown that FDR was a sensible measure of, balancing between the number of true positives and false positives in many genomewide studies. They proposed q-value-based approach, providing a more interpretable and consistent measure of significance across different studies, which in this paper they have provided four different cases for discussion. It helps to estimate the proportion of significant features that might turn out to be false positives, aiding in subsequent biological verification. Different from FDR, it provide feature-specific estimate, i.e. a localized estimation for each individual feature, helping with comparison and prioritization of individual findings.


## Questions for discussion
How does qvalue differ from the traditional FDR adjustment? 

What are the cases that we cannot easily apply this modified adjustment to obtain qvalues?
