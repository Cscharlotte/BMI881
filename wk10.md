# Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates
## Summary of the paper
This paper discovered that in the fMRI analyses, parametric statistical models are conservative for voxelwise inferecence and invdalidate clusterwise inference. They found that the spatial autocorrelation functions which do not follow Gaussain assumption can be cause of the problem. The authors used  real resting-state data
and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the three commonly used fMRI softwares. With the discovery of errornous p-values, they explored the impact of spatial smoothness on the results and found that the spatial autocorrelation function had a specific shape, which affected the validity of parametric methods. By comparison, they also found that the nonparametric permutation test could produce nominal results for voxelwise and clusterwise inference. 

## Reaction to the paper
The paper seesm to be a pretty important and significant for the field of fMRI analyses. As the authors have mentioned, the functional MRI has been used for 25 years, but surprisingly the statistical methods which were widely used are not validated on real data. One interesting finding by the authors was that the assumptions of the null distribution for fMRI data are not correct, for instance, it did not take the assumption of gaussian shape. This makes me think about usually when we develop new methods based on real data, especially when we are conducting statistical analysis, in many cases we have made prior assumptions. In most cases, it helps to simplify the modeling and makes our methods and results more perfect. However, this paper gives us a good reflection on the need of testing methods on various data, and for people use statistical methods, all should be aware of any prior condition we had before conducting any analysis, seeing whether there could be any violation of that.

## Questions for discussion
Except what were discussed by the authors, are there any other possible causes of the FPR inflation? 

How they gonna treat/ treated the studies using these softwares, but now found to be wrong findings?
