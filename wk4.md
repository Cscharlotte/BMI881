# The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial Results
## Summary of the paper 
The paper presented the findings based on LRC-CPPT, which is a randomized and double-blind study, taking place at 12 clinics. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of lowering cholesterol levesl for primary prevention of coronary heart disease(CHD). 3806 middle-aged male participants with primary hypercholesterolemia were enrolled and split into treatment group receiving bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine resin and control group receiving placebo, and their ECGs, dietary recalls and complete physicla examinations were checked at (semi)annual visits. The statistical test for main hypothesis of this study used a statistic comapring the life-table survival curves in two groups. Generally, the authors found that the cholestyramine group experienced a 19% reduction in risk of definite CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and they concluded that lowering LDL-C level can diminish the incidence of CHD morbidity and mortality in men with high risk for CHD. In addition, the authors conducted more analysis stating that the reudction was mediated by reduction of Total-C and LDL-C levels.

## Reaction to the paper
This study was a pretty standard clinical trial paper in 1980s. The study also followed a standard rule of enrolling and selecting participants as well as typical double-blind and randomization. Some of the results the authors have concluded might be statistically meaningful. However, the study was somewhat restricted and some results were controversial. For example, the authors did not justify their post-hoc determination of the \alpha-level. Meanwhile, there was a post-hoc change on the primary endpoint analysis. There was a confusion about absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction, leading to an exaggeration in the effect of the treatment.
