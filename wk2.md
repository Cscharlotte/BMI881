## Summary of the paper
In this paper, the authors used a JASA issue and a few corresponding exmaples to make the statement that converting tables to graphics in some statistical papers can be better to demonstrate numerical results. There are in total seven example they were using to justify their statement. Mostly, the studies will provide subjects with information in various display formats, asking a variety of questions based on this given information, in a way of either reading off specific information, comparing data etc. The examples ranges from simple numerical comparison; comparing ratios with numerators and denominators varying over several orders of magnitude; comparing methods for computing standard errors; comparing regression coefficients under different model assumptions; summarizing asymptotic properties of a statistical method; comparing several methods of estimating odds ratios; three-variable data display. The authors has shown all numerical displays here can be presented in a graphical way and comparabale to the tabular form in terms of size, which they claimed to be beneficial while possibly more time-consuming for the creators and readers to make or understand the graphics.
## Reaction to the paper
Generally, I like the idea what the paper was trying to argue for, espeically consdering the time that this paper was published. Sometimes we still see many data to be presented in a tedious way of listing all the information in a table in some papers, which is really hard for readers to capture the main idea or important information from it. I agree with the authors, espeically in the examples they have listed, graphical demonstration is more clear to present their results. However, in some of the examples, for instance, when summarizing asymptotic properties of a statistical method, I personally feel like the amount of time I spent on interpreting the figures is comparable to or more than that spent on reading off the numerical values. If the original table was organized better, it would also get more clear. Meanwhile, except the time consumed on interpretation, graphics in genearal can potentially be more misleading as authors can mislabel, use wrong scales or just misrepresnt the data or the readers can simply misunderstand the meaning of figures.
## Questions for discussion
What can be the case that table is absolutely better than graphics?
When we use graphics to demonstrate research results, what should we be cautious about?
What are the other things you can think about when presenting numerical results in a paper?
