# 50 Years of Data Science
## Summary of the papers
The article discusses the shift from traditional statistics to the rise of data science. It highlights the controversy around data science programs in universities and proposes a broader vision for data science based on learning from data. 
The author criticized "big data" as a defining criterion for distinguishing statistics from data science, and pursuing for complex computation, where some of the tasks can in fact be solved by using very simple models. Meanwhile, 
it was questionable about the actual demand for graduates with data science degrees. The author proposed a different framework for understanding data science as more aligned with statistics but expands to encompass the science of 
learning from data. The author organized many insights that was published over the years about the field of data science, discussing the gradual evolution of statistics towards a more comprehensive embrace of data science, 
propelled by people including Tukey, P. J. Huber, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, and William S. Cleveland, and facilitated by the advancement of computational softwares. Also, Breiman's article was disucssed about the favoring of generative modeling, 
limiting its scope and missing opportunities in predictive modeling, which then can be achivable by using data. However, in terms of education, merging statistical and database training raises uncertainties about the program's future 
focus and faculty research, leaving the direction of these programs open for speculation. A concept called Greater Data Science, was put forward, to expand framework comprising six divisions, but not only restricted to emphasis on modeling.
The author was expecting that by 2065, empirical evidence will have more influence than mathematical derivation and proof in determining conclusions. Novel methodologies arising from theory will be valued based on their empirical benefits, 
repeatedly tested in prevalent problems.

## Reaction to the papers
From the paper, we all realize that education in data science is difficult, especially areas like data exploration and transformation, often left for students to figure out on their own. There's a debate about teaching generalized concepts 
versus specialized cases. Multiple skills, including math, computer science and other subjects are actulaly required in a depth to format a data science field. Meanwhile, there is also a potential obstacle in education in a broader sense, that
many softwares or resources are English-only. For non-English spearkers, they need to learn more than expected. Donoho's vision offered valuable insights, implementing Greater Data Science in academia will require thoughtful curriculum design, 
supportive academic environments, and recognition of diverse scholarly contributions. It is also interesting to mention that bringing knowledge from industria could be potentially helpful to bring new thoughts to academia.



## Questions for discussion
What is the significance of the six divisions in GDS? Which division do you consider most critical and why?

How feasible is it for educational institutions to incorporate the broader GDS framework into their existing curriculum?
