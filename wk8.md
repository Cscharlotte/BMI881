# Skin Cancer
## Summary of the paper
The paper focuses on the development of a skin cancer risk prediction model, on nonmelanoma skin cancer, using a convolutional neural network. The study used a dataset comprising 2 million clinical declaration files and in-hospital declaration files from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, including patient demographics, classification of diseases, ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes, details of prescriptions. The patients range from 20 to 90 years old with 3-year health records. For the models, they leveraged clinical diagnostic and medical records with temporal continuity. The authors have developed three models as the first one only used ICD-9-CM diagnostic information, while the second model used only medication information. Then the third model incorporated both ICD-9-CM diagnostic information and drug prescriptions. Meanwhile, feature identification was performed through stepwise elimination of diagnostic and drug variables. As a result, the third model achieved a sensitivity of 83.1% and a specificity of 82.3%, along with an AUC of 0.894. 

## Reaction to the paper
This paper is a pretty standard paper that people utilized machine learning tools on developing prediction models for disease risks using EHR data. By using CNN models, the approach want beyond traditional risk assessment methods, with a relatively high AUC. It also helped to identify precancerous lesions and use of some photosensitizing medications, which could be used as discriminiative fatcors for prediction. However, there were definitely some limitation on the paper. Firstly, the generalizability might not be good as the original data used for training was only from one single population, and it was unknown its performance on other population. Meanwhile, there could be other potential informationto be included, such as different levels of skin cancer, exposure to be included for better prediction. For deep learning models, the difficulty of interpretation for the model is always a problem existed. In a clinical setting, a uninterpretable model still had problem to make everybody pursuaded to fully rely on it.

## Questions for discussion
What are the implications of some identified discriminative features, such as medications and comorbid chronic diseases?

How clinically meaningful are the model's sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values?
