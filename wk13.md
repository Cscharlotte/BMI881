# Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing
## Summary of the papers
This was the pioneer paper putting together all previous efforts and forward the idea of false discovery rate (FDR) controlling in multiple testing. Traditionally, controlling the Familywise Error Rate (FWER) has been the standard approach, while it had limitations. In the case when all hypotheses are true, FDR is equivalent to the FWER but it is smaller otherwise. It suggested controlling the FDR as an error rate to manage multiplicity, integrating concerns about the number of errors and the probability of false rejections, and increasing potential power. The authors has mentioned three different scenarios when controlling FDR is essential: 1. an overall decision (e.g., recommending a new treatment over a standard one) is based on multiple inferences, 2. when multiple separate decisions are required across various subgroups, 3. screening various chemicals for drug development or testing multiple factors in an experimental design. Then, the authors discussed the formulation and implementation of their thoughts through statistical approaches and emphasized the importance of controlling it using clinical and simulation studies.

## Questions for discussion
How does the proposed FDR controlling procedure differ from FWER-based methods in managing multiple comparisons?

Are there any limitations of the proposed FDR controlling procedure that researchers should consider when applying it to their studies?
