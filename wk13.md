# Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing
## Summary of the papers
This was the pioneer paper putting together all previous efforts and forward the idea of false discovery rate (FDR) controlling in multiple testing. Traditionally, controlling the Familywise Error Rate (FWER) has been the standard approach, while it had limitations. In the case when all hypotheses are true, FDR is equivalent to the FWER but it is smaller otherwise. It suggested controlling the FDR as an error rate to manage multiplicity, integrating concerns about the number of errors and the probability of false rejections, and increasing potential power. The authors has mentioned three different scenarios when controlling FDR is essential: 1. an overall decision (e.g., recommending a new treatment over a standard one) is based on multiple inferences, 2. when multiple separate decisions are required across various subgroups, 3. screening various chemicals for drug development or testing multiple factors in an experimental design. Then, the authors discussed the formulation and implementation of their thoughts through statistical approaches and emphasized the importance of controlling it using clinical and simulation studies.


## Reaction to the papers
Frankly speaking, I was not very surprised when reading the paper, since we have already used the concept of FDR controlling widely in our daily research. However, if I were people back to that time, I would be amazed by the work, which mentioned an important thing about false discovery rate when doing multiple comparison, largely affecting the validaty of many researches. The authors have done pretty solid and rigorous proof on formulas and utilized practical cases to support the idea. The shift towards prioritizing the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses could intrigued researchers with its flexibility and potential to balance the trade-off between making discoveries and controlling errors. One point interested me was that the authors mentioned previous concerns about false rejected hypotheses, while the latest was four years before they submitted their work about FDR, which was quite a long time. 



## Questions for discussion
How does the proposed FDR controlling procedure differ from FWER-based methods in managing multiple comparisons?

Are there any limitations of the proposed FDR controlling procedure that researchers should consider when applying it to their studies?
